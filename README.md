## Making Commits

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for its commit messages. All contributors should follow the specification when creating commits.

The project contains a commit template to streamlines the process. This can be found at `.cctemplate`. To use the template, run the following command from the root of your local application:

```bash
 git config commit.template .cctemplate
 ```

 When making new commits the template will be opened in the user configured editor of choice and can be modified. The first line is mandatory and all other content is optional.
